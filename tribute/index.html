            The person I admire most is <strong>APJ Abdul Kalam</strong>, the former President of India, a brilliant scientist, and an inspiring human being. 
            His dedication, humility, and passion for empowering young minds have always motivated me. 
            He believed that dreams transform into thoughts and thoughts result in action.

            His speeches and books continue to inspire millions. He always encouraged students to think big and never give up, 
            which is a lesson I carry with me every day.
